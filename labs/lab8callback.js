/*In the code below thereâ€™s a setTimeout call scheduled, then a heavy calculation is run, that takes more than 100ms to finish.

When will the scheduled function run?

A,After the loop.
B,Before the loop.
C,In the beginning of the loop.
What is alert going to show?

//Answer

//Any setTimeout will run only after the current code has finished.

//The i will be the last one: 100000000.

let i = 0;

setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100); // 100000000
